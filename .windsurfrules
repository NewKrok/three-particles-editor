# Three Particles Editor - Development Rules

## General Guidelines
- The project aims to update the three-particles-editor to support @newkrok/three-particles package version 2.0.2
- Use TypeScript instead of JavaScript, with typedefs (not interfaces or classes)
- Remove JSDoc comments in favor of TypeScript type definitions
- Follow Conventional Commit format for version control

## Code Conventions
- File extensions: .ts for TypeScript files, .svelte for Svelte components
- Import paths: should not contain extensions (.js, .ts) for TypeScript files
- Code formatting: Use ESLint and Prettier to ensure code quality
- Pre-commit checks: Use Husky and lint-staged

## API Changes Handling
- Use THREE.MathUtils.degToRad instead of THREE.Math.degToRad
- Replace MinMaxNumber type with Constant | RandomBetweenTwoConstants | LifetimeCurve types
- Update default values (e.g., startLifeTime from 2.0 to 5.0)
- Implement conversion function to transform old configurations to the new format

## Version Control
- Development happens on the v2.0.0 branch
- The master branch contains the stable, released version
- Each significant change is in a separate commit
- Commit messages follow the conventional commit format (feat, fix, refactor, etc.)

## Build and Deployment
- The contents of the public/build folder are not version controlled
- Static assets (e.g., images) are stored in the src/assets folder
- The development server runs using sirv-cli from the public folder

## Dependencies
- @newkrok/three-particles: 2.0.2 (target version)
- three.js: 0.155.0
- Use sass instead of node-sass
- Use Svelte framework for the user interface
